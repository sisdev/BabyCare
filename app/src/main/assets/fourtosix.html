    These are general guidelines for feeding healthy babies. Feed your baby only one new food per week. Then you can find out if your baby has a problem with the new food.
    Talk with the nutritionist or health care provider for more information on feeding your baby.

<ul>


<p>For Liquids (breast milk or formula) :<p/>     
                 



<li>5-7 oz. every 4-5 hours about 5 times a day (24-36 oz.)</li><br/>

<p>For Solids (liquid-soaked rice cereal, later try adding grain cereals):<p/>
<li>Start with mixing 1 teaspoon dry iron-fortified rice cereal with 4 to 5 teaspoons breast milk or formula. Little by little thicken mixture by increasing to 1 tablespoon dry cereal combined with breast milk or formula. Mixture should be fed twice a day.</li>
<li> Remember not to prop the bottle as little ones can often choke this way. And though there are even propping devices sold, feeding time should be bonding time. Try to simulate breastfeeding rituals even if bottle feeding. Look into babyï¿½s eyes, stoke their back,</li>

<li>  Create an intimate space.	</li>
<li>  Use a pacifier if baby just wants to suck	</li>
