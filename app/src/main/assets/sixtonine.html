    These are general guidelines for feeding healthy babies. Feed your baby only one new food per week. Then you can find out if your baby has a problem with the new food.
    Talk with the nutritionist or health care provider for more information on feeding your baby.

<p>For Liquids (breast milk or formula):</p>
<ul>
<li>7-8 oz. about every 6 hours approximately 4 times a day (24-32 oz.)</li></ul><br>


<p>For Solids (iron-fortified cereals, pureed or strained fruits and vegetables): </p>
<ul><li>3 to 9 tablespoons cereal given over 2 to 3 feedings per day</li>

<li>1 teaspoons vegetable, gradually increased to 1/4 to 1/2 cup in 2 to 3 feedings per day</li>
<li>Be sure to introduce new foods one at a time, to ensure your sweet babe is not allergic. Wait at least three days in between each new food</li>
<li>Pureed or strained fruits to try include banana, pears, applesauce, peaches, apricots, plums, and avocado (yes, avocado is a fruit!)</li>
<li>Pureed or strained vegetables to try include well-cooked carrots, squash, sweet potato, green beans, and peas</li>
