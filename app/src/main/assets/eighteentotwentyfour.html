	These are general guidelines for feeding healthy babies. Feed your baby only one new food per week. Then you can find out if your baby has a problem with the new food.
	Talk with the nutritionist or health care provider for more information on feeding your baby.
</p>

<p>For Liquids:</p>
				<ul><li>	Approx. 12-20 oz. cow�s/soy milk per day</li>
				<li>	You may continue to breastfeed as long as you and baby would like; baby will self-regulate amounts. Continue to introduce solids</li>
				<li>Your growing babe should have three to six cups of water per day including the water in breast milk, juices, whole milk and food. Supplement with drinking water</li></ul>
			<p>	For Solids:</p><ul>
				<li>	Dairy: 4 daily servings; 1/2 Cup; 3/4 Ounce Cheese</li>
				<li>	Bread: Cereal, Rice and Pasta: 6 daily servings; 1/2 Slice or 1/4 Cup</li>
				<li>	fruit: 3 daily servings; 1/4 Cup Cooked; 1/2 Cup Raw</li>
				<li>	Vegetables: 2 daily servings; 1/4 Cup Cooked; 1/2 Cup Raw</li>
				<li>	Protein: 2 daily servings; 1 Tablespoon; 1 Egg; 1/2 Cup Cooked Beans</li></ul>
				<li>Offer your little love three meals and two or three snacks each day, but remember that it�s quite common for your 18-24 month old to skip meals</li> 
				<li>Skipping a meal may be a difficult concept for you, but children need to learn to listen to internal cues for hunger and fullness</li> 
				<li>Don�t be a pusher; allow a kid who�s not hungry to wait it out. Allowing children to eat on demand all day can be just as harmful</li>
			<li>	Continue serving iron-fortified cereal until your child is 18 to 24 months old to ensure correct iron levels and counteract possible anemia</li>
			<li>	Speak with your doctor if you�re considering giving your child a vitamin supplement</li>
