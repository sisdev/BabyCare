	These are general guidelines for feeding healthy babies. Feed your baby only one new food per week. Then you can find out if your baby has a problem with the new food.
	Talk with the nutritionist or health care provider for more information on feeding your baby.

<ul>


<p>Birth to 3 weeks:<p/>     
                 



<li>1/2 - 1 oz. increasing to 4 oz. every 2-3 hours about 8 times a day (12-24 oz.)</li><br/>

<p>3 Weeks-4 Months:<p/>
<li> 4-6 oz. every 3-4 hours about 6 times a day (24-32 oz.)</li>
<li> The wee oneï¿½s digestive tract is still developing, so keep all feedings liquid. No solids yet.</li>

<li>  Rooting reflex,a reflex seen in newborn babies causing them to automatically turn their face toward the stimulus and make sucking movements, helps your baby find nourishment organically.
