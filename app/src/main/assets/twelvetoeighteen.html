	These are general guidelines for feeding healthy babies. Feed your baby only one new food per week. Then you can find out if your baby has a problem with the new food.
	Talk with the nutritionist or health care provider for more information on feeding your baby.

			<ul><li>	Approx. 4 oz. cow�s/soy milk (or yogurt) up to 4 times a day</li>
