	These are general guidelines for feeding healthy babies. Feed your baby only one new food per week. Then you can find out if your baby has a problem with the new food.
	Talk with the nutritionist or health care provider for more information on feeding your baby.

<p>For Liquids (breast milk or formula):</p>

<p>For Solids (iron-fortified cereals, pureed or strained fruits and vegetables, small amounts of dairy products, finger foods, proteins, non-citrus juice):</p>
			<ul>
			<li>1/4 to 1/3 cup dairy (or 1/2 oz. cheese) per day.</li>
			<li>1/4 to 1/2 cup iron-fortified cereal per day</li>
			<li>1/4 to 1/2 cup fruit per day</li>
			<li> 1/4 to 1/2 cup vegetables per day</li>
			<li>1/8 to 1/4 cup protein foods per day</li>
			<li> 3 to 4 oz. non-citrus juices per day</li>
			            
			<li> Start feeding in high chair</li>
			<li> Try using a cup for juice. Remember, juice doesn�t replace breast milk or formula. Non-citrus juices include apple or pear</li>
			<li> Feed only foods that will dissolve in baby�s mouth</li>
			<li> Dairy products suitable for baby include soft pasteurized cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese; no cow�s milk till 1 year</li>
			<li> Fruit and vegetables can now be cut into cubes or strips and fed to baby, as can purees and mashes. Vegetables should always be bite-sized and soft-cooked until tender</li>
			<li> Small amounts of proteins should be introduced. These can include egg, pureed meats and poultry as well as boneless fish. Tofu is also a great baby protein. Also try offering baby well-cooked and/or mashed beans with soft skins like lentils, split peas, pintos, black beans</li>
			<li> Finger foods include cut-up lightly-toasted bagel pieces, well-cooked piece pasta (no noodles), teething crackers, and low-sugar cereals</li>
			<li> It is also during the later of the months that combo foods can be given to baby. Try tasty treats like macaroni and cheese or casseroles</li>
   
			</ul>
